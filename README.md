# Text_Categorization_with_SVM_Algorithm


Data Collection: Gather a dataset of texts with corresponding categories.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data (tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, removing stopwords).
Feature Extraction: Convert text data into numerical features (e.g., using TF-IDF).
Model Training: Use an SVM classifier to train the model on the processed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
Application Interface: Develop a user interface to input new text and display the predicted category.


 consider a text categorization app that classifies news articles into different categories like "Sports", "Politics", "Technology", and "Health". I'll provide a small dataset example to illustrate this.

## Sample Dataset
## Categories:
- Sports
- Politics
- Technology
- Health
- Texts:

## Sports:
- "The local team won the championship after a thrilling game."
- "Olympic athletes prepare for the biggest challenge of their careers."
## Politics:
- "The election campaign heats up as candidates debate key issues."
- "New policies introduced aiming to boost economic growth."
## Technology:
- "Tech giants unveil latest innovations at the annual conference."
- "Breakthrough in renewable energy technology promises a greener future."
## Health:
- "Researchers discover new treatment for a rare disease."
- "Global health organizations warn about rising levels of obesity."

Let's consider two new texts for prediction in the context of the categories we discussed (Sports, Politics, Technology, and Health). Here are the texts:

Text for Prediction 1:
- "Groundbreaking software revolutionizes the way we interact with our smart devices."

This text appears to be related to Technology because it mentions "groundbreaking software" and "smart devices," which are typically topics in the technology sector.

Text for Prediction 2: 
- "World Health Organization releases new guidelines for managing pandemic-related stress."

This text is likely to be categorized under Health, as it refers to the "World Health Organization" and "managing pandemic-related stress," which are health-related topics.
